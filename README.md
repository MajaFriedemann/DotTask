# About this project

Boldt and Yeung's (2015) dot discrimination task is a perceptual decision-making task in which participants are asked to judge which of two boxes contains the greater number of dots and to report their confidence in each judgment on a rating scale. Staircasing is used to maintain a constant level of performance.
This is a "social" version where the participant sees an partner's response and confidence rating after reporting their own. This is the strategic version where participants where the decision reported with higher confidence will be taken as the joint decision based on whose accuracy the participant is rewarded at the end of the experiment. Objective feedback is provided on each trial as well as on average per block.
