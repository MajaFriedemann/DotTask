# About this project

Boldt and Yeung's (2015) dot discrimination task is a perceptual decision-making task in which participants are asked to judge which of two boxes contains the greater number of dots and to report their confidence in each judgment on a rating scale. Staircasing is used to maintain a constant level of performance.
This is a "social" version where the participant sees an adivor's response and confidence rating after reporting their own.
