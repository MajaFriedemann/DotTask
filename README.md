# About this project

This package of web-based experimental tasks was created as part of a PhD project investigating individual differences in how people make and self-assess decisions.

## Information Sampling Task with Confidence (ISTc)

A novel version of the information sampling task (Clark et al., 2006). Clark et al.'s information sampling task is a probabilistic reasoning task which assesses the amount of information people gather before making a decision as a behavioural measure of reflection impulsivity. The ISTc adds a confidence dimension to the information sampling task by collecting subjective confidence ratings during the information sampling phase and at the point of decision.

## Dot Discrimination Task with Information-Seeking (DDTi)

A novel version of the standard dot discrimination task (Boldt & Yeung, 2015). Boldt and Yeung's dot discrimination task is a perceptual decision-making task in which participants are asked to judge which of two boxes contains the greater number of dots and to report their confidence in each judgment on a rating scale. The DDTi adds an information sampling dimension to the dot discrimination task by offering participants the option to see additional information (i.e., an easier version of the dot stimuli) before committing to a final decision. Like in the original dot discrimination task, staircasing is used to maintain a constant level of performance for the initial decision (before seeing again) within and across participants.
